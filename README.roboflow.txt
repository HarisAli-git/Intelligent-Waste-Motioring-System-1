==============================

This dataset was exported via roboflow.ai on April 2, 2022 at 12:38 PM GMT

It includes 295 images.
Garbage are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Equal probability of one of the following 90-degree rotations: none, clockwise, counter-clockwise

The following transformations were applied to the bounding boxes of each image:
* Random shear of between -15째 to +15째 horizontally and -15째 to +15째 vertically
